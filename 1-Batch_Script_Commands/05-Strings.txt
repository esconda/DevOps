1)Creating String
A string can be created in DOS in the following way.
Example: 
    @echo off 
    :: This program just displays Hello World 
    set message = Hello World 
    echo %message%

Output:
    Hello World

2)Empty String
An empty string can be created in DOS Scripting by assigning it no value during itâ€™s initialization as shown in the following example.
Set a= -> Empty String
[%a%]==[] -> Comparison with empty string

Example: 
    @echo off 
    SET a= 
    SET b=Hello 
    if [%a%]==[] echo "String A is empty" 
    if [%b%]==[] echo "String B is empty "

3)String Interpolation
String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, 
and expressions by including their values inside a string literal.
Example : 
    @echo off 
    SET a = Hello 
    SET b = World 
    SET /A d = 50 
    SET c=%a% and %b% %d%
    echo %c%

Output :
    Hello and World 50

4)String Concatenation
You can use the set operator to concatenate two strings or a string and a character, or two characters. 
Following is a simple example which shows how to use string concatenation.

Example :
    @echo off 
    SET a = Hello 
    SET b = World 
    SET c=%a% and %b% 
    echo %c%

5)String Length
In DOS scripting, there is no length function defined for finding the length of a string.

6)String ToInt
A variable which has been set as string using the set variable can be converted to an integer using the /A switch which is using the set variable. 
The following example shows how this can be accomplished.
Example : 
    @echo off
    set var = 13145
    set /A var=%var% + 5
    echo %var%
Output : 
    13150
