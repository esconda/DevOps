1)Command Line Arguments
Batch scripts support the concept of command line arguments wherein arguments can be passed to the batch file when invoked. 
The arguments can be called from the batch files through the variables %1, %2, %3, and so on.

Example: 
    @echo off 
    echo %1 
    echo %2 
    echo %3

Input Call: 
    test.bat 1 2 3


2) Set Command
The other way in which variables can be initialized is via the ‘set’ command. Following is the syntax of the set command.

Syntax : 
   set /A variable-name=value

where,
* variable-name is the name of the variable you want to set.
* value is the value which needs to be set against the variable.
* /A – This switch is used if the value needs to be numeric in nature. 

Example:
    @echo off 
    set message=Hello World 
    echo %message%

3)Working with Numeric Values
In batch script, it is also possible to define a variable to hold a numeric value. This can be done by using the /A switch.

Example : 
    @echo off 
    SET /A a = 5 
    SET /A b = 10 
    SET /A c = %a% + %b% 
    echo %c%

4)Local vs Global Variables
Example : 
    @echo off 
    set globalvar = 5
    SETLOCAL
    set var = 13145
    set /A var = %var% + 5
    echo %var%
    echo %globalvar%
    ENDLOCAL
