1) Creating an Array
set a[0]=1 -> An array is created by using the following set command.

Example : 
    @echo off 
    set list=1 2 3 4 
    (for %%a in (%list%) do ( 
        echo %%a 
    ))

Output: 
    1
    2
    3
    4

2) Accessing Arrays
You can retrieve a value from the array by using subscript syntax, 
passing the index of the value you want to retrieve within square brackets immediately after the name of the array.

Example: 
    @echo off
    set a[0]=1 
    set a[1]=2 
    set a[2]=3 
    echo The first element of the array is %a[0]% 
    echo The second element of the array is %a[1]% 
    echo The third element of the array is %a[2]%

Output: 
    The first element of the array is 1 
    The second element of the array is 2 
    The third element of the array is 3

3)Modifying an Array
To add an element to the end of the array, you can use the set element along with the last index of the array element.

Example:
    @echo off 
    set a[0]=1  
    set a[1]=2  
    set a[2]=3 
    Rem Adding an element at the end of an array 
    Set a[3]=4 
    echo The last element of the array is %a[3]%

4)Iterating Over an Array
Iterating over an array is achieved by using the ‘for’ loop and going through each element of the array. 
The following example shows a simple way that an array can be implemented.

Example:
    @echo off 
    setlocal enabledelayedexpansion 
    set topic[0]=comments 
    set topic[1]=variables 
    set topic[2]=Arrays 
    set topic[3]=Decision making 
    set topic[4]=Time and date 
    set topic[5]=Operators 

    for /l %%n in (0,1,5) do ( 
     echo !topic[%%n]! 
    )

5)Length of an Array
The length of an array is done by iterating over the list of values in the array since there is no direct function to determine the number of elements in an array.

Example:
    @echo off 
    set Arr[0]=1 
    set Arr[1]=2 
    set Arr[2]=3 
    set Arr[3]=4 
    set "x = 0" 
    :SymLoop 

    if defined Arr[%x%] ( 
        call echo %%Arr[%x%]%% 
        set /a "x+=1"
        GOTO :SymLoop 
    )
    echo "The length of the array is" %x%

6)Creating Structures in Arrays

Example : 
    @echo off 
    set obj[0].Name=Joe 
    set obj[0].ID=1 
    set obj[1].Name=Mark 
    set obj[1].ID=2 
    set obj[2].Name=Mohan 
    set obj[2].ID=3 
    FOR /L %%i IN (0 1 2) DO  (
        call echo Name = %%obj[%%i].Name%%
        call echo Value = %%obj[%%i].ID%%
    )
